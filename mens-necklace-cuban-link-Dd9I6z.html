<h3>Rolex Waitlist Nightmare: Broken Promises and Deafening Silence 😤</h3>
<p></br>
I'm sharing my frustrating experience as a cautionary tale about promises made but not kept. My husband desperately wanted the Rolex Datejust Wimbledon, the 41mm in steel. We visited Shreve and Co at Stanford, where Brandon, a very pleasant associate, took our information for the waitlist. He made us feel incredibly hopeful for 'good news' soon. Yet, after that initial, promising interaction, there's been zero communication. This complete lack of follow-up has left me utterly frustrated and feeling forgotten, which is why I'm reaching out to customer service and leaving this review.</p>
<p>Customer: Hi, I'm calling about a disappointing lack of follow-up for a Rolex waitlist.
CS Rep: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please explain what happened?
Customer: My husband and I visited your Stanford store a few months ago for a Rolex Datejust Wimbledon waitlist. Brandon took our details, made us feel we'd hear back soon, but it's been months with no communication. We feel completely forgotten.
CS Rep: I understand your frustration. Please accept our apologies for the silence. I'll look up your husband's details. Could you provide his name and your visit date?
Customer: His name is [Husband's Name], around [Month] for the 41mm steel Wimbledon. It’s just disheartening to have no idea where we stand.
CS Rep: Thank you. I see no activity since your visit. This isn't our standard. I'll immediately contact our Stanford management and Brandon for an update on his position and ensure priority follow-up. Would you like a call back within 24 hours?
Customer: Yes, please. I just want to know the actual situation. This has been very disappointing.
CS Rep: Absolutely, I'll personally ensure you receive that call. We regret this oversight.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap of unmet expectations and poor communication.

After a recent incredibly frustrating online shopping experience, where promises of follow-up and 'good news' turned into absolute silence, I was left utterly disheartened and feeling forgotten 😤.
