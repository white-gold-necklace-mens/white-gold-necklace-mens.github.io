<h3>Phantom Promises & Radio Silence: My Rolex Waiting List Nightmare at Shreve & Co. 😤</h3>
<p></br></p>
<h3 id="myterriblecustomerserviceexperiencepostvisitacautionarytale">My Terrible Customer Service Experience Post-Visit: A Cautionary Tale</h3>
<p>My terrible customer service experience post-visit with Shreve &amp; Co., particularly concerning the lack of follow-up after my initial visit, has compelled me to share this cautionary tale. What began with such high hopes, where I found myself saying, "I stopped by the new store and met Erik. I asked to see a Rolex watch, fell in love and now I’m on the waiting list. Erik was very knowledgeable about Rolex in general and they had a great showroom full of beautiful jewelry and watches. I’m looking forward to getting that call from Erik when the watch I want comes in (hopefully soon). Thanks Erik!" – has utterly soured. Months have passed with no word, no call, no communication whatsoever, making that initial promise feel hollow. I felt compelled to leave this review and engage with customer service because the complete radio silence after being placed on a "waiting list" is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>Customer: Hello, I'm calling about my experience with the waiting list for a Rolex watch. I visited your store months ago, met Erik, and was told I'd be contacted. The review I left, "I stopped by the new store and met Erik. I asked to see a Rolex watch, fell in love and now I’m on the waiting list. Erik was very knowledgeable about Rolex in general and they had a great showroom full of beautiful jewelry and watches. I’m looking forward to getting that call from Erik when the watch I want comes in (hopefully soon). Thanks Erik!" describes my initial high hopes. But it’s been absolute silence since. I'm incredibly disappointed.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I'm truly sorry to hear about your frustrating experience and the lack of communication, especially after such a positive initial visit with Erik. I understand how disheartening it must be to be left without an update for so long. Can I please get your name and the approximate date of your visit so I can look into this for you?</p>
<p>Customer: It was around six months ago, my name is [Customer Name]. I just feel completely forgotten. What's the point of a waiting list if there's no communication at all? I was genuinely excited, and now I just feel misled.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I'm pulling up your details now, [Customer Name]. I completely agree that a lack of communication is unacceptable, and it's certainly not the experience we want our clients to have. It looks like your interest for the Rolex Submariner No-Date is still active on our system. I can see Erik's notes from your visit. It seems there might have been an oversight in follow-up.</p>
<p>Customer: So, what does that mean? Is the watch still potentially available, or have I just been on a phantom list for half a year? I want to know what’s going on and if there's any real chance of getting the watch I wanted.</p>
<p>CS Rep: I understand your skepticism. What I can do immediately is reach out to Erik and the watch department directly for a current status update on your specific request. I will personally ensure you receive a call or email with a clear update within 24 hours, even if it's just to confirm your position or explain any delays. Would that be acceptable?</p>
<p>Customer: Yes, that would be a start. I just want some transparency. Thank you.</p>
<p>The reason I left this review on the website is to hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

My last shopping experience, at a different luxury store, left me utterly frustrated and feeling completely forgotten 😤. I was promised a call about a watch I was on a waiting list for, but after months of absolute radio silence, it became clear their "waiting list" was nothing more than a phantom promise. The lack of communication and being misled was simply unacceptable 😭.</p>
<p>After that disheartening ordeal, I was incredibly wary of making another purchase, but I desperately needed a reliable and straightforward experience 🤔. That's why I decided to give blingcharming.com a try, hoping for something different. And boy, was I pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>My experience purchasing the Flower Shape Necklace was exceptional. The customer service team was professional, knowledgeable, and patient, answering all my questions promptly online. Thanks to their efficiency, I received my beautiful necklace within a week. The entire online process was smooth and enjoyable from start to finish. ✨</p>
